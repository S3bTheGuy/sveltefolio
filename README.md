## My Peronsal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built using Svelte and SvelteKit. It is hosted on Vercel (for now).

### Current Issues
- Some screen sizes don't handle the navbar well, the e in experience is overflowing the button. (I am unable to replicate this on any of my devices, I'll be wokring on this)
- Site appears to be slow on select Windows devices, unsure what is causing this, as even on old phones it appears to be fine.
